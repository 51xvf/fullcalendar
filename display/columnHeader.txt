columnHeader *3.6.0*
====================

For the Agenda and Basic views, whether the day columns should appear.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
Boolean, *default*: `true`
</div>

The default is to show these columns, but if you would like to hide the column header, especially if you have a single-day view and you feel the column header is unnecessary, you can set it to `false`.
