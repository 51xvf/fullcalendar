resourcesInitiallyExpanded *scheduler 1.8*
==========================================

In Timeline view, whether child resources should be expanded when the view loads.

<div class="spec" markdown="1">
Boolean, *default*: `true`
</div>

By default, all child resources are visible, but if you'd like child resources to be collapsed, meaning they are not initially visible, change this setting to `false`.
